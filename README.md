# IdeaBox

by: Eric O'Neill, Amy Rippeto, and Alyssa Lundgren

## Introduction
IdeaBox allows users to save their ideas and access them in the future. Their created idea cards persist across browser sessions and will remain in their browser's local storage until deleted by the user. Upon page reload their ideas presist and reappear within their ideas window. Users are given the opportunity to star their idea, enhance the listed quality of their idea, and delete their ideas.  

## The Project and Our Process
The IdeaBox was our team's first opportunity to utilize JSON and localStorage to persist content across browser sessions, capturing user inputs for use later. 

Prior to sitting down to write any code, we began pen to paper drawing the comp and discussing the contents of the page as a group. Wireframing the provided IdeaBox design before writing any code allowed our team to develop semantic HTML from the very beginning. We added classes and IDs based on our forecasting of the upcoming functionality requirements. 

From there, we focused on building out the structure within HTML and styling the page using CSS. We utilized Grid to style our idea cards and the body of our page. 

Once our HTML and styling was satisfactory we began pseudocoding our functionality. We created a global ideas array variable and began working on event listeners within Phase One. This project allowed our team to invoke both parse() and stringify() as we worked to get our ideas into localStorage.  Within the scope of work we also created a seperate Idea JavaScript file and instantiated and re-instantiated our idea objects as necessary to invoke our Ideas methods within our main JavaScript file. 

## Team Reflection
We are happy with the workflow, teamwork and project outcome. We all worked collaboratively on each aspect of the project, and were able to grow, ask questions, and increase our understanding.
